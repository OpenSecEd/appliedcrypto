Module: Applied Cryptography (appliedcrypto)
===============================================================================

This is a learning module for Applied Cryptography.  It's aim is to cover 
high-level cryptography --- mechanisms and their properties --- such that the 
students are aware of the possibilities and (if desired) can apply them when 
designing secure systems.

The module is part of the [Open Security Education][OpenSecEd] project and the 
maintainer is [Daniel Bosk][Maintainer].  The latest release can be found under 
[releases][Releases].  You can safely link directly to the PDFs found there.

File Structure and Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*To build* the PDFs, after cloning the repository you must clone its required 
submodules:
```shell
$ git submodule update --recursive --init
```
Then you can go into the directory of the desired document and run `make`.
The source files are structured as follows:

- `bitcoin` contains slides for how to analyse properties and design a system 
  using proper crypto mechanisms.

In each directory the files are structured as follows:

- `<name>.tex` contains the main content.
- `aims.tex` is an itemized list of the intended learning outcomes, as such it 
  can be included in another document summarizing the list of intended learning 
  outcomes.
- `abstract.tex` is an abstract of the lecture, assignment, or similar, and 
  covers the required reading instructions, thus you can include these in 
  a study guide containing all reading instructions for the course.
- `<name>.bib` contains the bibliography entries, thus this file can be 
  included along with the reading instructions.
