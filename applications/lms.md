The lecture will be interactive. We will work in groups to design two systems. 
First, we'll (re)design a secure electronic postbox (think [Kivra][kivra]).
Second, if time permits, we'll (re)design a secure and private [BankID][bankid] 
remake that fits our needs for our Kivra redesign.

# Watching and reading to do

It's good if you watch these videos and read the papers before the lecture, but 
it's not crucial, you can watch and read them afterwards.

These materials are provided as interactive learning material through 
FeedbackFruits. Just register an account using any email address. (They require 
an account to keep track of who commented on what, notifications when someone 
replies to you etc.)

## Signal protocol

Overview of Signal:

- X3DH: authentication (interactive [video][x3dh], [document][x3dh-paper])
- Double Ratchet: message encryption (interactive 
  [video][double-ratchet-messaging], [document][double-ratchet-paper])

A more detailed discussion:

- Signal and the double ratchet (more technical) (interactive 
  [video][dodis-signal], very technical [paper][dodis-paper])

Another protocol (standard) and some discussion about groups:

- Messaging Layer Security: Towards a New Era of Secure Group Messaging
