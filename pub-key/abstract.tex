Public-key cryptography has a central role in modern cryptographic solutions, 
it ranges from HTTPS to electronic ID systems.

The \acp{ILO} are that you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{apply} various public-key cryptography primitives in 
    situations based on their high-level properties.
\end{itemize}

The basics are covered by
Chapter 5 in Anderson's \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
Chapter 14 in Gollmann's \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
Furthermore, we refer to the \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS}.
