\emph{Summary:}
Public-key cryptography has a central role in modern cryptographic solutions, 
it ranges from HTTPS to electronic ID systems.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
You should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{analyse} a problem situation to determine suitable properties 
    and
  \item to \emph{apply} various public-key cryptography primitives in suitable 
    situations determined by their high-level properties.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
This topic is partly covered by
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 5 in \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
  \item \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS}.
\end{itemize}
