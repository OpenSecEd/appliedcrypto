*Summary:* Public-key cryptography has a central role in modern
cryptographic solutions, it ranges from HTTPS to electronic ID systems.

*Intended learning outcomes:* You should be able

-   to *analyse* a problem situation to determine suitable properties
    and

-   to *apply* various public-key cryptography primitives in suitable
    situations determined by their high-level properties.

*Reading:* This topic is partly covered by

-   Chapter 5 in  (Anderson 2008) and

-    (Van Tilborg and Jajodia 2011).
