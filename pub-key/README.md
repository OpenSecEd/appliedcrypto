[Public-Key Cryptography](https://youtu.be/jP5yI9VN8cM) introduces the area of 
public-key cryptography: key-exchanges protocols, public-key encryption, 
digital signatures. This is a core part of modern cryptography used in practice 
and it significantly reduces the key-management problem of shared-key 
cryptography.
