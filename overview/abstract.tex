To fully understand how many security mechanisms can be implemented we need 
cryptography, as cryptography has a central role in a lot of security.
This learning session is intended to give a high-level overview of 
cryptography: symmetric cryptography, public-key encryption, digital 
signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and multi-party computation.

We will treat
Chapter 5 in Anderson's \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
Chapter 14 in Gollmann's \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
To practice your understanding of these mechanisms it is recommended to do 
exercises 14.2, 14.3 and 14.7 in~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
