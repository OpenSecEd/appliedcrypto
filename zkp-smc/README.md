[Zero-Knowledge and Multiparty Computation](https://youtu.be/2s8yipfKUZU) 
introduces two important building blocks for constructing highly secure 
services. Zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge are a core primitive used in many 
scenarios, e.g. for authentication or correctness during protocol runs. 
Multiparty computation allows several mistrusting parties to do joint 
computations including each individual's secret data.
