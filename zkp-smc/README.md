[![Video: Zero-Knowledge and Multiparty 
Computation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2s8yipfKUZU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2s8yipfKUZU) 

*Summary:* This session introduces two important building blocks for
constructing highly secure services. Zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge
are a core primitive used in many scenarios, e.g. for authentication or
correctness during protocol runs. Multiparty computation allows several
mistrusting parties to do joint computations including each individual’s
secret data.

*Intended learning outcomes:* You should be able

-   to *apply* zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge and secure multiparty
    computation based on the high-level properties of the primitives and
    the situation at hand.

*Reading:* The topic is covered by

-   various entries in  (<span class="citeproc-not-found"
    data-reference-id="EOCS">**???**</span>).
