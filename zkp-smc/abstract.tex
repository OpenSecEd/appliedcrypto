This session introduces two important building blocks for constructing highly 
secure services. Zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge are a core primitive used 
in many scenarios, e.g. for authentication or correctness during protocol runs. 
Multiparty computation allows several mistrusting parties to do joint 
computations including each individual's secret data.

The \acp{ILO} are that you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{apply} zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge and secure 
    multiparty computation based on the high-level properties of the primitives 
    and the situation at hand.
\end{itemize}

We refer to the articles on these topics in the \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS} 
for reading.
