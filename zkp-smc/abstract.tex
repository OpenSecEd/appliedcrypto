\emph{Summary:}
This session introduces two important building blocks for constructing highly 
secure services. Zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge are a core primitive used 
in many scenarios, e.g. for authentication or correctness during protocol runs. 
Multiparty computation allows several mistrusting parties to do joint 
computations including each individual's secret data.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
You should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{apply} zero-knowledge proofs-of-knowledge and secure 
    multiparty computation based on the high-level properties of the primitives 
    and the situation at hand.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
The topic is covered by
\begin{itemize}
  \item various entries in \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS}.
\end{itemize}
