\emph{Summary:}
Shared-key cryptography is the traditional approach to cryptography and the 
aspect of cryptography that comes as intuitive for most people.
We instroduce definitions of security, theoretical models, how they relate to 
practical implementations and provable security.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this, you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{understand} what properties can be achieved with shared-key 
    cryptography and their definitions of security.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
This material is covered by the following literature:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 5 in \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea},
  \item \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS}.
\end{itemize}
