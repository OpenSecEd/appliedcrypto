[![Video: Shared-Key 
Encryption](https://img.youtube.com/vi/83WDuPKToFo/hqdefault.png)](https://youtu.be/83WDuPKToFo) 

Shared-key cryptography is the traditional approach to cryptography and
the aspect of cryptography that comes as intuitive for most people. We
instroduce definitions of security, theoretical models, how they relate
to practical implementations and provable security.

The [ILOs]{acronym-label="ILO" acronym-form="plural+short"} are that you
should be able

-   to *understand* what properties can be achieved with shared-key
    cryptography and their definitions of security.

The basics are covered by Chapter 5 in Anderson's  [@Anderson2008sea]
and Chapter 14 in Gollmann's  [@Gollmann2011cs]. For the remaining
topics, we refer to the  [@EOCS] (and cited papers and books).
