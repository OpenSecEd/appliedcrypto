*Summary:* Shared-key cryptography is the traditional approach to
cryptography and the aspect of cryptography that comes as intuitive for
most people. We instroduce definitions of security, theoretical models,
how they relate to practical implementations and provable security.

*Intended learning outcomes:* After this, you should be able

-   to *understand* what properties can be achieved with shared-key
    cryptography and their definitions of security.

*Reading:* This material is covered by the following literature:

-   Chapter 5 in  ,

-    .
