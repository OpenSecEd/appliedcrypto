Explain why we need message-authentication codes, what problem do they solve?

\begin{solution}
  Alice and Bob share a key (not through Diffie--Hellman key-exchange), they 
  can encrypt their messages and they know Eve cannot read them.

  Eve can drop them, modify them, replay them.
  It's impossible to prevent Eve from dropping messages.
  We can use message-authentication codes to detect modifications.
\end{solution}
