One-way functions is a core building block in modern cryptography.
This session covers the basic property, hash functions and \acp{MAC}.

The \acp{ILO} are that you should be able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{apply} one-way functions to security problems.
\end{itemize}

The basics are covered by
Chapter 5 in Anderson's \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
Chapter 14 in Gollmann's \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
%We will also cover some topics from 
%\citetitle{KatzLindell-v1}~\cite{KatzLindell-v1} and 
%\citetitle{GoldreichFOC-1}~\cite{GoldreichFOC-1}.
We also refer to the \citetitle{EOCS}~\cite{EOCS}.
