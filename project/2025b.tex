As shopping has moved online, the transportation of goods from shops to homes 
has moved from people bringing what they have bought home themselves to 
delivery services delivering them home.
However, people are not always at home---they work or study---which complicates 
things.
There are a few such services around, such as
\begin{description}
  \item[PostNord, DHL and Schenker] deliver parcels to the door for signing,
    they can leave it outside the door if nobody is at home,
    they can also drop it at a service centre where the recipient can fetch it.
    PostNord can additionally drop it in a mail box, or
    they deliver it to a parcel box where the recipient can fetch it.
  \item[Budbee and Instabox] deliver parcels to the nearest parcel box, then 
    the recipient must fetch the package there.
\end{description}

We want to design a general system that these companies can use for 
implementing their services.
We want it to be as usable and as secure as possible.
It should also consider privacy in its design.

\begin{exercise}
  Think about how you would design a system using cryptographic primitives to 
  ensure the functionality, usability and security of the system.
\end{exercise}

\ltnote{%
  The idea is to create the simplest solution possible.
  Then we will focus one aspect at a time by making one small change to the 
  solution at a time.
  This will introduce the contrast necessary to bring the aspect into 
  focus \parencite[as dictated by][]{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}.
  We will do this until we have touched on all aspects and arrived at the 
  perfect solution.
  (One could also think of this as a sequence of games, as used in cryptography 
  \parencite{Shoup2004Sequences}.
  Arguably, the reason why the sequences of games method by 
  \citeauthor{Shoup2004Sequences} is good for humans is explained by 
  \citeauthor{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}.)
