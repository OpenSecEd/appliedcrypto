\chapter{Delivering parcels}\label{ParcelBoxes}

  This chapter is from DD2520 Applied Crypto, spring 2025, at KTH\@.
}

As shopping has moved online, the transportation of goods from shops to homes
has moved from people bringing what they have bought home themselves to
delivery services delivering them home.
However, people are not always at home---they work or study---which complicates
things.
There are a few such services around, such as
\begin{description}
  \item[PostNord, DHL and Schenker] deliver parcels to the door for signing,
    they can leave it outside the door if nobody is at home,
    they can also drop it at a service centre where the recipient can fetch it.
    PostNord can additionally drop it in a mail box, or
    they deliver it to a parcel box where the recipient can fetch it.
  \item[Budbee and Instabox] deliver parcels to the nearest parcel box, then
    the recipient must fetch the package there.
\end{description}

We want to design a general system that these companies can use for
implementing their services.
We want it to be as usable and as secure as possible.
It should also consider privacy in its design.

\ltnote{%
  The idea is to use more open form of pQBL~\parencite{pQBL}.
  This means that we start with a question.
  This lets the reader think about the problem, try to explore it based on what
  they currently know.
  When we later tell them, the knowledge will be more
  reinforced~\parencite{Szekely1950}.
  This also helps the reader to discern relevant
  aspects~\parencite{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}.

  The intention of \cref{ParcelBenefits,ParcelDrawbacks} is to let the
  reader discover the relevant security and usability properties that we want
  to capture in the coming protocol design.
}
\begin{exercise}\label{ParcelBenefits}
  What are the benefits of parcel boxes compared to home delivery or
  service centre pickup?
\end{exercise}

Parcel boxes offer convenience: recipients can pick up parcels at any time
without coordinating schedules with delivery personnel.
The delivery company can deliver more efficiently since they only visit fixed
locations rather than individual homes.

\begin{exercise}\label{ParcelDrawbacks}
  What are the security and privacy concerns with parcel boxes?
\end{exercise}

There are several concerns:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Who can open the box? We need to ensure only the intended recipient
    can retrieve their parcel.
  \item How do we prove the parcel was delivered? The sender and delivery
    company need proof in case of disputes.
  \item What if the box is tampered with? We need to detect if someone has
    modified the box's hardware or software.
  \item Privacy: the system operator learns when and where people pick up
    parcels, revealing shopping habits and locations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
  Think about how you would design a system using cryptographic primitives to
  ensure the functionality, usability and security of the system.
\end{exercise}

\ltnote{%
  The idea is to create the simplest solution possible.
  Then we will focus one aspect at a time by making one small change to the
  solution at a time.
  This will introduce the contrast necessary to bring the aspect into
  focus \parencite[as dictated by][]{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}.
  We will do this until we have touched on all aspects and arrived at the
  perfect solution.
  (One could also think of this as a sequence of games, as used in cryptography
  \parencite{Shoup2004Sequences}.
  Arguably, the reason why the sequences of games method by
  \citeauthor{Shoup2004Sequences} is good for humans is explained by
  \citeauthor{NecessaryConditionsOfLearning}.)
}


\section{A first solution}\label{ParcelFirstSolution}

Now we'll start with a first solution to the problem.
We can identify several entities in \cref{ParcelBoxes}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the customer~\(C\) who orders goods and will pick them up,
  \item the delivery person~\(D\) who delivers parcels to boxes,
  \item the parcel box~\(B\) where parcels are temporarily stored,
  \item the backend server~\(S\) that coordinates the system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
  What is the goal of the system, in terms of these entities?
\end{exercise}

The goal is that the delivery person~\(D\) can deposit a parcel in box~\(B\),
and only the intended customer~\(C\) can retrieve it.
The server~\(S\) coordinates who has access to which compartment and when.

\begin{exercise}
  Design a cryptographic system that ensures only authorized parties can
  access the parcel box.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Symmetric key approach}

\NewVariable{\KBS}{k_{BS}}
\NewVariable{\KToken}{k_{\text{token}}}
\NewAlgorithm{\MAC}{HMAC}
\NewAlgorithm{\Enc}{Enc}
\NewAlgorithm{\Dec}{Dec}

The simplest design uses a shared symmetric key~\(\KBS\) between each
box~\(B\) and the server~\(S\).
The server stores all box keys in a secure database.

When a customer~\(C\) needs to access a box, they authenticate to the
server~\(S\) (for example, using BankID or similar strong authentication).
The server then generates an access token for that specific box and
compartment.

\begin{exercise}
  How should the access token be constructed?
\end{exercise}

The token needs to specify:
\begin{itemize}
  \item which box and compartment to access,
  \item who is authorized (the customer's identity),
  \item when the token is valid (time window),
  \item what operations are allowed (deposit or retrieve).
\end{itemize}

We can construct the token as:
\[
  \text{token} = (\text{box\_id}, \text{compartment}, \text{user\_id},
  t_{\text{start}}, t_{\text{end}}, \text{permission})
\]
and compute an HMAC to authenticate it:
\[
  \tau = \MAC[\KBS, \text{token}].
\]

The customer receives \((\text{token}, \tau)\) from the server via the
mobile app.
When they approach the box, the app transmits the token and HMAC via
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
The box verifies: \(\tau \stackrel{?}{=} \MAC[\KBS, \text{token}]\).

See \cref{fig:ParcelAccess} for the protocol.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{sidecaption}[Access protocol for parcel box]{%
    The customer~\(C\) authenticates to server~\(S\), receives an access
    token with HMAC, and presents it to box~\(B\).
    The box verifies the HMAC using its shared key with the server.
    If valid and the time window is current, access is granted.
  }[fig:ParcelAccess]
  \flushright
  \begin{msc}
    [/msc/action width=0.35\linewidth]
    {Parcel box access protocol}
      \declinst{cust}{Customer \(C\)}{App}
      \declinst{serv}{Server \(S\)}{\(\KBS\) for all boxes}
      \declinst{box}{Box \(B\)}{\(\KBS\)}
      \mess{Authenticate (BankID)}{cust}{serv}
      \nextlevel[2]
      \mscaction{Generate token, \(\tau = \MAC[\KBS, \text{token}]\)}{serv}
      \nextlevel[2]
      \mess{token, \(\tau\)}{serv}{cust}
      \nextlevel[2]
      \mess{token, \(\tau\) (via BLE)}{cust}{box}
      \nextlevel
      \mscaction{Verify \(\tau \stackrel{?}{=} \MAC[\KBS, \text{token}]\)}{box}
      \mscaction{Check time window and permissions}{box}
      \nextlevel
      \mess{Access granted/denied}{box}{cust}
      \nextlevel
  \end{msc}
  \end{sidecaption}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Preventing token replay}

\begin{exercise}
  What happens if an attacker intercepts the BLE transmission and replays
  the token later?
\end{exercise}

The token includes a time window \((t_{\text{start}}, t_{\text{end}})\).
The box has a trusted clock (synchronized via the network or GPS).
A replayed token will fail if the current time is outside the window.

However, within the valid time window, replay is possible.
To prevent this, the box can cache recently used tokens and reject duplicates.
A better approach: include a nonce in the token that the box marks as
\enquote{used} after the first access.

\subsection{Key management}

\begin{exercise}
  How should the symmetric keys be managed?
\end{exercise}

Each box~\(B\) is provisioned with its key~\(\KBS\) during manufacturing or
installation.
The key is stored in a secure element (TPM or similar) within the box.
The server stores all keys in an encrypted database, with the database
encryption key protected by an HSM.

Keys should be rotated periodically.
Since boxes may not always be online, we can use key derivation:
\[
  k_{BS}^{(i+1)} = \KDF[\text{next key}, k_{BS}^{(i)}].
\]
Both the box and server derive the new key at predetermined intervals.

\subsection{Consequences of the design}\label{ParcelConsequencesFirst}

\begin{exercise}
  Evaluate this design.
  What are its consequences (advantages and disadvantages)?
\end{exercise}

The design has several consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The box must have a trusted clock for time-based token validation.
    If the clock drifts or is manipulated, security is compromised.
  \item The server knows exactly when and where each customer accesses
    parcels---a significant privacy concern.
  \item There is no proof of delivery.
    If a dispute arises about whether a parcel was delivered, there is no
    cryptographic evidence.
  \item The box must be online to receive key rotations or can use
    predetermined key derivation.
  \item Token replay within the valid time window is a concern; caching
    used tokens helps but requires storage.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Adding proof of delivery}\label{ProofOfDelivery}

\ltnote{%
  We now introduce the concept of non-repudiation through digital signatures.
  This creates contrast with the previous symmetric-key-only approach,
  helping students discern the difference between authentication
  (which symmetric keys provide) and non-repudiation (which requires
  asymmetric cryptography).
}

The first solution lacks proof of delivery.
If a customer claims they never received their parcel, or if the delivery
company claims they delivered it, there is no way to resolve the dispute
cryptographically.

\begin{exercise}
  How can we provide proof that a parcel was delivered to a specific box?
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Signed delivery records}

\NewAlgorithm{\Sign}{Sign}
\NewAlgorithm{\Ver}{Verify}
\NewVariable{\SKD}{sk_D}
\NewVariable{\PKD}{pk_D}

When the delivery person~\(D\) deposits a parcel, they should create a
signed record that cannot later be denied.
We give each delivery person a key pair \((\SKD, \PKD)\) for digital
signatures.

The delivery record contains:
\[
  \text{record} = (\text{parcel\_id}, \text{box\_id}, \text{compartment},
  \text{timestamp}, \text{photo\_hash})
\]
where \(\text{photo\_hash}\) is a hash of a photo taken at delivery time.

The delivery person signs this record:
\[
  \sigma = \Sign[\SKD, \text{record}].
\]

This signature provides non-repudiation: the delivery person cannot later
deny having made the delivery, since only they possess~\(\SKD\).

\begin{exercise}
  How should the delivery person's keys be managed?
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Per-shift certificates}

Managing long-term keys for potentially thousands of delivery personnel is
complex.
A better approach: generate temporary key pairs for each work shift.

At the start of a shift:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The delivery person authenticates to the server (e.g., via the
    company app).
  \item The app generates a fresh key pair \((\SKD, \PKD)\).
  \item The app sends \(\PKD\) and a certificate signing request to the
    server.
  \item The server signs a certificate binding \(\PKD\) to the delivery
    person's identity, valid only for this shift.
\end{enumerate}

The private key~\(\SKD\) never leaves the delivery person's device.
At shift end, the key pair is discarded.
If a dispute arises, the server can verify signatures using the archived
certificate.

See \cref{fig:DeliveryProof} for the delivery protocol.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{sidecaption}[Proof of delivery protocol]{%
    The delivery person~\(D\) deposits a parcel, takes a photo, and signs
    a delivery record.
    The signed record and photo are uploaded to the server.
    The box also logs the delivery event.

      \mscaction{Verify \(\sigma\), store proof}{serv}
      \nextlevel
  \end{msc}
  \end{sidecaption}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Photo privacy considerations}

\begin{exercise}
  What privacy concerns arise from delivery photos?
\end{exercise}

Photos may capture bystanders, building entrances, or other sensitive
information.
Under GDPR and similar regulations, this personal data must be protected.

Mitigations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Process photos only in memory; never write unencrypted photos to
    disk on the delivery device.
  \item Encrypt photos immediately with the server's public key before
    transmission.
  \item Define data retention policies: delete photos after dispute
    resolution deadlines pass.
  \item Minimize what the photo captures: focus on the box compartment,
    not the surroundings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consequences of the design}

\begin{exercise}
  Evaluate this improved design.
  What are its new consequences?
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Non-repudiation: delivery personnel cannot deny deliveries they
    made, providing dispute resolution capability.
  \item Photo storage creates GDPR compliance obligations.
  \item The server must manage certificates and maintain an archive for
    potential disputes.
  \item Per-shift key generation requires the delivery person's device to
    have secure key generation capabilities.
  \item The customer still lacks cryptographic proof of pickup (only the
    delivery is proven, not the retrieval).
\end{enumerate}


\section{Offline operation with signed tokens}\label{OfflineOperation}

\ltnote{%
  We now introduce asymmetric signatures for access tokens, creating
  contrast with the HMAC-based tokens from \cref{ParcelFirstSolution}.
  This helps students discern that asymmetric signatures enable offline
  verification (the box only needs the server's public key), while HMAC
  requires shared secrets.
}

In \cref{ParcelFirstSolution}, the box needs the shared key~\(\KBS\) to
verify HMAC tokens.
What if the box cannot reach the server to receive key updates, or if we
want boxes to be completely standalone?

\begin{exercise}
  How can we design access tokens that boxes can verify without any
  shared secret with the server?
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Asymmetrically signed tokens}

\NewVariable{\SKS}{sk_S}
\NewVariable{\PKS}{pk_S}

Instead of HMAC, the server signs tokens using its private key~\(\SKS\).
Each box is provisioned with the server's public key~\(\PKS\) during
installation.

The token is now:
\[
  \text{token} = (\text{box\_id}, \text{compartment}, \text{user\_id},
  t_{\text{start}}, t_{\text{end}}, \text{permission}, \text{nonce})
\]
with signature:
\[
  \sigma_{\text{token}} = \Sign[\SKS, \text{token}].
\]

The box verifies: \(\Ver[\PKS, \text{token}, \sigma_{\text{token}}]
\stackrel{?}{=} \text{true}\).

This is similar to JSON Web Signatures (JWS) used in many web
authentication systems.

\begin{exercise}
  What algorithm should we use for the signatures?
\end{exercise}

We should use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with a
curve like P-256 or P-384.
ECDSA provides strong security with smaller signatures and faster
verification than RSA, which is important for resource-constrained boxes
communicating via BLE.

\subsection{Certificate chain for boxes}

\begin{exercise}
  How can boxes trust that \(\PKS\) is authentic?
\end{exercise}

We establish a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):
\begin{description}
  \item[Root CA] The delivery company (or a trusted third party) operates
    a root certificate authority.
  \item[Server certificate] The server's public key \(\PKS\) is certified
    by the root CA.
  \item[Box provisioning] Each box is manufactured with the root CA's
    public key embedded in its secure element.
\end{description}

During installation or first boot, the box receives the server's
certificate and verifies it against the root CA.
This enables the box to trust~\(\PKS\) even if it never contacts the
server directly afterwards.

See \cref{fig:OfflineAccess} for the offline-capable protocol.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{sidecaption}[Offline-capable access protocol]{%
    The customer receives a signed token from the server.
    The box verifies the signature using the server's public key, which
    it obtained during provisioning.
    No real-time connection to the server is needed.
  }[fig:OfflineAccess]
  \flushright
  \begin{msc}
    [/msc/action width=0.35\linewidth]
    {Offline access protocol}
      \declinst{cust}{Customer \(C\)}{App}
      \declinst{serv}{Server \(S\)}{\(\SKS\)}

      \mess{Authenticate, request token}{cust}{serv}

      \mscaction{\(\sigma = \Sign[\SKS, \text{token}]\)}{serv}

      \nextlevel
      \mess{Access granted/denied}{box}{cust}
      \nextlevel
  \end{msc}
  \end{sidecaption}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Token revocation challenges}

\begin{exercise}
  What if a token needs to be revoked before it expires?
\end{exercise}

With asymmetric tokens, the box doesn't contact the server during access.
This means the server cannot revoke a token mid-validity.

Mitigations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use short validity windows (e.g., 15 minutes) to limit exposure.
  \item For high-value parcels, require online verification.
  \item When boxes do connect (for maintenance, logs upload), they can
    download a revocation list.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consequences of the design}

\begin{exercise}
  Evaluate this design.
  What are its consequences compared to the HMAC approach?
\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Boxes can operate completely offline after initial provisioning.
    This improves reliability and reduces infrastructure requirements.
  \item Tokens cannot be revoked in real-time.
    Short validity windows partially mitigate this.
  \item The box needs a trusted clock; if manipulated, expired tokens
    could be accepted.
  \item Key management is simpler: boxes only need one public key
    (or a certificate chain), not unique shared secrets.
  \item If the server's private key~\(\SKS\) is compromised, all tokens
    can be forged.
    The key must be protected in an HSM.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Privacy-preserving design}\label{PrivacyDesign}

\ltnote{%
  We now explore advanced cryptographic techniques to address privacy
  concerns.
  This creates contrast with all previous designs where the server knows
  exactly who accesses what.
  Students should discern that privacy often requires more complex
  cryptographic machinery (blind signatures, zero-knowledge proofs).
}

In all previous designs, the server learns exactly when and where each
customer picks up parcels.
This reveals shopping habits, home locations, and daily schedules---a
significant privacy concern.

\begin{exercise}
  How can we design a system where the server cannot learn which box a
  customer accesses?
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Blind signatures for access tokens}

\NewAlgorithm{\Blind}{Blind}
\NewAlgorithm{\Unblind}{Unblind}

One approach uses blind signatures.
The customer blinds their access request before sending it to the server:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Customer wants token for box~\(B\), compartment~\(c\).
  \item Customer creates: \(\text{request} = (B, c, \text{nonce})\).
  \item Customer blinds: \(\text{blinded} = \Blind[\text{request}, r]\)
    using random blinding factor~\(r\).
  \item Customer sends \(\text{blinded}\) to server with proof of
    authorization (without revealing~\(B\) or~\(c\)).
  \item Server signs blindly: \(\sigma' = \Sign[\SKS, \text{blinded}]\).
  \item Customer unblinds: \(\sigma = \Unblind[\sigma', r]\).
  \item Now \(\sigma\) is a valid signature on the original request, but
    the server never saw it.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
  How does the server know the customer is authorized without seeing
  which box they want to access?
\end{exercise}

This requires a separate authorization proof.
The customer proves (perhaps using zero-knowledge techniques) that they
have a valid delivery notification for \emph{some} box, without revealing
which one.

This is complex to implement correctly.
Simpler alternatives include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Using an anonymizing proxy or onion routing so the server sees
    the request but not who sent it.
  \item Decentralizing: have boxes generate their own tokens after
    verifying a capability from the server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trade-offs}

\begin{exercise}
  What are the trade-offs of privacy-preserving designs?
\end{exercise}

\begin{description}
  \item[Complexity] Blind signatures and zero-knowledge proofs require
    careful implementation and are computationally heavier.
  \item[Auditability] If the server doesn't know who accessed what,
    investigating abuse becomes harder.
  \item[Dispute resolution] Non-repudiation may conflict with privacy if
    we need to prove a specific person picked up a parcel.
  \item[Regulatory requirements] Some jurisdictions may require audit
    trails that conflict with strong privacy.
\end{description}

\subsection{Consequences of the design}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Strong privacy: the server learns only that \emph{someone}
    authorized accessed \emph{some} box, not who or which.
  \item Significant implementation complexity; requires cryptographic
    expertise to implement securely.
  \item Dispute resolution becomes harder since the link between customer
    and access is obscured.
  \item May conflict with legal requirements for audit trails.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Hardware security and legal considerations}\label{HardwareLegal}

\ltnote{%
  We now consider aspects beyond pure cryptographic protocol design:
  the physical security of devices and legal/regulatory requirements.
  This helps students discern that a complete system design must consider
  implementation security, not just protocol security.
}

\begin{exercise}
  Even with perfect cryptographic protocols, what could go wrong if the
  box hardware is compromised?
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Secure boot and firmware integrity}

The box runs software that implements our protocols.
If an attacker can modify this software, they can bypass all
cryptographic protections.

To prevent this:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The box uses secure boot: at power-on, a chain of trust verifies
    that each software component is signed by the manufacturer.
  \item Firmware updates are signed; the box only accepts updates signed
    with the manufacturer's key.
  \item The signing keys for firmware are protected in HSMs, with
    multi-person authorization required for signing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tamper detection}

\begin{exercise}
  How can we detect if someone has physically tampered with a box?
\end{exercise}

Physical security measures include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tamper-evident seals that show if the enclosure has been opened.
  \item Tamper-responsive modules that erase cryptographic keys if
    physical intrusion is detected.
  \item Regular integrity checks where boxes report their status to the
    server.
\end{itemize}

If a box is compromised, its keys should be revoked and the box taken
out of service.

\subsection{Legal and regulatory requirements}

\begin{exercise}
  What legal requirements must the system satisfy?
\end{exercise}

\begin{description}
  \item[GDPR] Personal data (access logs, photos) must be protected.
    Data minimization: collect only what's necessary.
    Data retention: delete data after the purpose is fulfilled.
    Data subject rights: customers can request their data.
  \item[Consumer protection] Proof of delivery may be required for
    consumer disputes.
    The cryptographic proof we generate serves this purpose.
  \item[Accessibility] Boxes should be usable by people with disabilities.
    This may affect authentication methods (not purely app-based).
  \item[Proportionality] Security measures should be proportionate to
    the value being protected.
    A parcel box doesn't need military-grade security.
\end{description}

\subsection{Usability considerations}

\begin{exercise}
  How do we make the system usable for non-technical users?
\end{exercise}

All cryptographic operations should be invisible to users:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The mobile app handles authentication, token management, and
    BLE communication.
  \item Users simply tap \enquote{open box} in the app and approach the box.
  \item Error messages should be user-friendly: \enquote{Your access
    window has expired, please request a new code} rather than
    \enquote{ECDSA signature verification failed}.
\end{itemize}

For delivery personnel, the app should:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automatically generate and manage shift certificates.
  \item Make photo capture and signing seamless.
  \item Work reliably even in areas with poor network coverage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final design summary}

Our complete system combines:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Asymmetrically signed tokens (JWS-style) for offline-capable
    box access.
  \item Per-shift certificates for delivery personnel.
  \item Signed delivery records with photo evidence for non-repudiation.
  \item PKI with certificate chains for trust establishment.
  \item Secure hardware (TPM, secure boot) for implementation security.
  \item GDPR-compliant data handling with appropriate retention policies.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
  Propose potential improvements or alternative approaches to this design.
  Consider scenarios such as: What if both the customer's phone and the
  box are compromised? What if the delivery company is the adversary?
\end{exercise}
