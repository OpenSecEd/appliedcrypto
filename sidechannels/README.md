[Sidechannels] looks at the difference between theory and practice. While 
crypto systems and protocols might be security in theory, the implementation 
details (e.g. hardware) are usually not covered in the model: this means that 
hardware behaviour, such as power consumption, can actually leak information 
about the data.
