\emph{Summary:}
When looking at secure systems it is easy to assume they are safe just because 
the secret keys are not directly reachable.
This is not always true.
Even if the key storage is unreachable, there is some information that can be 
extracted anyway.
For instance, the time an operation takes to perform reveals some information 
about the operands.
This is what is called side-channel information.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
You are able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{reflect} on the security of implementations, or lack thereof, 
    from the aspect of side-channels.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
The topci is covered by
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 17 of \cite{Anderson2008sea},
  \item \citetitle{genkin2013rsa}~\cite{genkin2013rsa} where the authors 
    extract RSA keys using acoustic side-channels, \ie they analyse the sound 
    emitted by the electrical circuitry to find the computations done and hence 
    derive the RSA key used.
\end{itemize}
