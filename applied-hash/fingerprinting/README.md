*Summary:* We talk about the fingerprinting property of hash functions.
We look at two example use cases: BitTorrent and Git.

*Intended learning outcomes:* You should be able to apply hash functions
in various settings.

*Prerequisites:* We assume that you know about hash functions in
general, but we recap the main properties.

*Reading:* You can learn more about Git's internals here:

A good starting point to get an overview of BitTorrent is its page on
Wikipedia:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent>

Otherwise, the BitTorrent specification is the authoritative source:
