\section{A secure guessing game}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}[Secure 20 questions]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eve says to Alice: \enquote{I'm thinking of something, guess what 
        it is.}
      \item Alice can't guess it in 20 questions, so she loses.
      \item Make a construction so that Alice can be sure Eve doesn't change 
        what she's thinking of.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}

  \begin{onlyenv}<2>
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Eve commits to her choice,
          \(C = H(\text{what Eve is thinking about})\).
        \item Eve gives \(C\) to Alice.
        \item Alice asks her 20 questions.
        \item Eve reveals her choice.
        \item Alice checks that \(C = H(\text{what Eve was thinking about})\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}
  \end{onlyenv}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eve says to Alice: \enquote{I'm thinking of something, guess what 
        it is.}
      \item Alice can't guess it in 20 questions, so she loses.
      \item Make a construction so that Alice can be sure Eve doesn't change 
        what she's thinking of.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{exercise}[More secure 20 questions]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Alice says: \enquote{I asked \(X\) and you answered \(Y\),
        but should've answered \(Y'\).}
      \item Eve says: \enquote{No, you asked \(X'\) and I answered \(Y\) 
        correctly.}
      \item Make a construction so that Alice can prove that she asked \(X\) 
        and Eve replied \(Y\).
      \item (And consequently, Alice can't cheat either.)

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What are the properties we want?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}

  \pause

  \begin{solution}[Desired properties]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Alice can't change her question.
      \item Eve can't change her answer.
      \item An answer is tied to the correct question.
      \item The order of the questions and answers is preserved.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{solution}[Alice nor Eve can change their statements]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each must store the other's messages.
      \item Hash is useful to save space.
      \item However, problems in recreating the \emph{exact} message.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}

  \pause

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Is a hash function sufficient?
      \item Is storing the entire message sufficient?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{solution}[An answer is tied to the correct question]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The answer can include the hash value of the question.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item And what not to forget?
      \item So what would it look like exactly?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{solution}[The order of the questions and answers is preserved]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each message can include the hash value of the previous message.
      \item This way, the order is preserved also for individual 
        question--answer pairs.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item So what would it look like exactly?

\section{Proving quotes from a document}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eve sent a love letter to Alice.
      \item In it, she confessed her love for Alice, but also included a proof 
        of \(P = NP\) as a token of her sincerity. (And consequently that she 
        could break all of Alice's crypto.)

        \pause

      \item A few years later \dots
      \item Unfortunately Eve has passed away.
      \item Bob claims to have proved \(P = NP\).
      \item Construct a system such that Alice can show Eve's proof, prove it 
        was Eve who signed it (and when), but without revealing the other parts 
        of the love letter.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We need a tree structure where we can access sufficiently different 
        parts of the letter.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}

  \pause

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What should be in the leaves?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How much is revealed about the hidden parts?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}
