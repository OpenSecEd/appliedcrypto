\section{A secure guessing game}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}[20 questions]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eve says to Alice: \enquote{I'm thinking of something, guess what 
        it is.}
      \item Alice can't guess it in 20 questions, so she loses.
      \item Make a construction so that Alice can be sure Eve doesn't change 
        what she's thinking of.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}

\section{Proving quotes from a document}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eve sent a love letter to Alice.
      \item In it, she confessed her love for Alice, but also included a proof 
        of \(P = NP\) as a token of her sincerity. (And consequently that she 
        could break all of Alice's crypto.)

        \pause

      \item A few years later \dots
      \item Unfortunately Eve has passed away.
      \item Bob claims to have proved \(P = NP\).
      \item Construct a system such that Alice can show Eve's proof, prove it 
        was Eve who signed it (and when), but without revealing the other parts 
        of the love letter.
