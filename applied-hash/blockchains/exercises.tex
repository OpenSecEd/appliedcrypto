\begin{exercise}
  Consider Git; if we let developers digitally sign each Git object name (i.e. 
  a hash value) of the commits that they produce, what security 
  property/properties does that give us? Why?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  A restatement is that we sign each commit object, since the hash of that 
  object is its name.

  A commit object contains the hashes of the parent commits (can be several), 
  the current state of the files (hashes).

  By signing a commit, we tie that data together. We can be sure what the 
  developer committed.

  But we can also be sure of the entire history that the developer had in his 
  repository. The commit refers to the parent commits, i.e. hashes. Those in 
  turn contains hashes of their parents. So we have a hash chain. To change any 
  part of history, we must find a desirable collision --- i.e. to solve the 
  second preimage problem, where the other preimage is exactly the state we 
  want. However, assume that parent commits are not signed. Then it's only the 
  current commit's name (hash) that must stay intact. But if every commit is 
  signed, then every parent's name must also remain fixed.
\end{solution}
