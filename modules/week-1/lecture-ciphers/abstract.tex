\emph{Summary:}
This lecture introduces ciphers (shared-key encryption) with focus on their
security properties and typical pitfalls.
We also study why classical ciphers fail and how they can be cryptanalysed.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this lecture, you should be able

\begin{itemize}
  \item to explain what symmetric (shared-key) encryption is and what it can
    and cannot guarantee;
  \item to describe why ECB leaks patterns and how common modes (CBC/CTR/CFB/OFB)
    with an IV/nonce avoid this;
  \item to explain the purpose of IVs/nonces and what can go wrong if they are
    misused;
  \item to perform basic cryptanalysis of Caesar and Vigen\`ere ciphers.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Prerequisites:}
Basic discrete mathematics and familiarity with probability at a high level.

\emph{Reading:}
Course notes and the recommended textbook readings for shared-key encryption.
