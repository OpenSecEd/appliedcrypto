### Content: Secure Communication Protocol Design

This topic is presented as a three-and-a-half lecture set.

In part 1, we will discuss what we mean by \"secure communication\" set
against the background of a quite general communication use-case. We
will gradually derive requirements that quantify what we mean by
\"secure\". You will hopefully recognize this as something you have used
when you access a server on the internet, or chat with friends. We
discuss a general structure for protocols implementing the requirements.
We will use the tools we have studied so far in the course
(symmetric/asymmetric encryption algorithms, MACs, hash-functions, etc)
to start to implement the security requirements.

In part 2, we continue to implement the remaining requirements.

In part 3, we will look at standards, in particular to see how they have
tackled the requirements from part 1 and we will recognize
solution-approaches that we developed in part 1 and 2. The standards we
look at are ones you hopefully recognize: secure internet access over
HTTPS and 4G/5G mobile network security.

In part 4, finally, we will look at some non-technical aspects related
to laws and regulations that you may encounter if you work with
designing or providing security solutions for secure communication.

### Content and Videos from 2022

#### Content: Protocols

The material from previous years differs quite a lot, and mainly focus
on selected issues from part 2 and 3. 

#### Slides [pdf](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/files/9512662/download?verifier=OhaztaUqaMuYzzt9I4SQL1OC3YPD3EDOycf7on98&wrap=1){api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/files/9512662" api-returntype="File"} [ppt](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/files/9512709/download?verifier=PBLHvVqO5yxZVZnJO70TC9YFXn5eSVlMVB2ScozR&wrap=1){api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/files/9512709" api-returntype="File"}. 

 

#### Content: Policies and crypto business

The first part was about policy (law and regulation) around crypto
usage: Export control and Lawful Intercept. This is basically an
extended version of part 4 of this year\'s lecture. We then look at
business aspects such as patents/IPR, detecting \"snake oil / fake
news\". This leads into the next lecture: risk-based security (that was
given by Karl).
