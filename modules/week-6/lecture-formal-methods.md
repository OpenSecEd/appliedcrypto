Introduction to formal methods and where they can be used in
crypto-design. Increasing assurance that a cryptographic system is
secure or that a security proof is correct via formal proofs. Defining
what it means to be secure, handling system complexity, formal proofs
and computer-aided verification.

**Reading:** Here\'s
a [link ](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/manual.pdf){.external
target="_blank"}to the ProVerif manual which you\'ll need for the [lab
exercise ](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/assignments/349959 "LIVE (MANDATORY) Lab 20/2, 26/2: Introduction to ProVerif  (Karl and Xiaomo) (preview)"){api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/assignments/349959"
api-returntype="Assignment"}and can have a look at before if you\'re
interested, it is a tutorial in itself thus more interesting than a
typical manual.\
