The lecture will be interactive. We will work in groups to design two
systems. First, we'll (re)design a secure electronic postbox (think
[Kivra](https://kivra.se/en/private)). Second, if time permits, we'll
(re)design a secure and private [BankID](https://www.bankid.com/en/)
remake that fits our needs for our Kivra redesign.

# Watching and reading to do

It's good if you watch these videos and read the papers before the
lecture, but it's not crucial, you can watch and read them afterwards.

These materials are provided as interactive learning material through
FeedbackFruits. See [Access to
