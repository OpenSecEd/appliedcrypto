  Abstract	= "A group signature scheme allows group members to issue
		  signatures on behalf of the group, while hiding for each
		  signature which group member actually issued it. Such
		  scheme also involves a group manager, who is able to open
		  any group signature by showing which group member issued
		  it. We introduce the concept of list signatures as a
		  variant of group signatures which sets a limit on the
		  number of signatures each group member may issue. These
		  limits must be enforced without having the group manager
		  open signatures of honest group members—which excludes
		  the trivial solution in which the group manager opens every
		  signature to see whether some group members exceed their
		  limits. Furthermore, we consider the problem of publicly
		  identifying group members who exceed their limits, also
		  without involving the group manager."
