I recommend that you attempt it\nbefore the corresponding lecture and then retake it again\nafterwards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grading\">Grading</h3>\n<p>If you fail, you will have to go study a bit more and complement your\nanswers. There is a <strong>one hour cool-down between\nattempts</strong>. You <strong>must have 100% correct answers</strong>\nto pass. Questions will not give partial credit, <strong>you get either\nfull score or none</strong>.</p>\n<p>I suggest that you write down a short motivation for each answer,\nsuch that you can review them for the next attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>There is no deadline.</strong> (Well, the deadline is when\nyou want to get the grade. When all INL1 assignments have a passing\ngrade in Canvas, they'll be automatically transferred to LADOK. This is\ndone once a week, then there might be a few days delay since one of us\nwill have to see the email notification and go certify the\nresults---i.e.&nbsp;click OK---manually in LADOK.)</p>\n",
