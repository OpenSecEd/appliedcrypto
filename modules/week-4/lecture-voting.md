### Content 

Traditional voting systems and electronic voting systems.

### Resources

We will first briefly recall how paper-based voting systems work. Then
we will watch
a [talk ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y99ry-m5R9I){.inline_disabled
target="_blank"}together about the [Open
Verificatum ](https://www.verificatum.org/ "Länk"){.inline_disabled
target="_blank" preview-alt=""} project. Our focus is the overview of
electronic voting systems at the beginning of the talk. We will then
have an open ended discussion about what are good arguments pro and con
such systems. (Note that a sponsor made the software free and open
source under the MIT License, so feel free to tinker with it.)
