### Content

We will talk about some real-world protocols that apply cryptography.

### Tutorial: Digital Postbox

We use Swedish digital postbox services (e.g. Min myndighetspost, Kivra, eBoks, 
Digimail) as a case study for designing a secure system using cryptography.

You will work in groups to design a secure digital postbox system. You will

- analyze security requirements (confidentiality, authenticity, access 
  control),
- examine what data vs metadata is exposed to whom,
- design a secure protocol for message delivery and access, and
- discuss potential vulnerabilities and mitigations.

This is a first design attempt. We return to this exercise in Week 6 after the 
lecture-series on protocol design.
