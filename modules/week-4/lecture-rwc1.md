### Content

We will talk about some real-world protocols that apply cryptography.

### Tutorial: Digital Postbox

We use Swedish digital postbox services (Kivra, eBoks, Digimail) as a case
study for designing a security-critical system.

In groups, you will:

- Design registration, sending, and reading functionality
- Analyze security requirements (confidentiality, authenticity, access control)
- Examine what data vs metadata is exposed to whom
- Consider anonymity extensions and digital identity requirements

This is a first design attempt. We return to this exercise in Week 6 with
protocol analysis tools.
