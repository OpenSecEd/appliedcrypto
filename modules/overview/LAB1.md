LAB1 consists of mandatory and optional assignments.

The mandatory assignments must be done and get a passing grade to pass the 
course. These are prefixed with "Mandatory".

The optional assignments determine the final grade of the course. Each
optional assignment that is passed increases the final grade. These assignments 
are prefixed with "Optional".

All these assignments are handed in and presented during the lab sessions.

There are two modules in LADOK: INL1 and LAB1. Which assignments belong
to which module can be found under
[Assignments](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/assignments "Assignments"){course-type="navigation" api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/assignments" api-returntype="[Assignment]"} (*select \"by type\" instead of the
default \"by date\" in the top right corner*). Then you can figure out
what\'s missing if you don\'t get your grades in LADOK.
