LAB1 consists of mandatory and optional assignments.

The mandatory assignments must be done and get a passing grade to pass the 
course. These are prefixed with "Mandatory".

The optional assignments determine the final grade of the course. Each
optional assignment that is passed increases the final grade. These assignments 
are prefixed with "Optional".

All these assignments are handed in and presented during the lab sessions.

You can find a list by going to the assignments tab and sorting by type (rather 
than date, which is the default) and look for the assignment group LAB1.
