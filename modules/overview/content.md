### Course contents

Basic concepts and principles of cryptography, intuition about safety,
implementation and engineering aspects as well as influence on society,
black box analysis, use of cryptographic primitives as symmetric and
asymmetric encryption in applications, digital signatures, cryptographic
hash functions and simple crypto systems and cryptographic protocols.

 

### Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student should be able to:

-   use basic terminology in computer security and cryptography
    correctly
-   describe cryptographic concepts and explain their security
    properties
-   find and use documentation of cryptographic libraries and standards
-   identify and categorise threats against a cryptographic IT-system at
    a conceptual level, suggest appropriate countermeasures and present
    the reasoning to others

in order to

-   as citizen and engineer be able to discuss applied cryptography in
    general, and risks of using/developing cryptography in particular
-   in professional life and/or research and development project be able
    to evaluate challenges in software development related to
    cryptography.

 

### Course literature

The main literature of the course is

Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone, [Handbook
of Applied Cryptography](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/){.c-link
target="_blank" stringify-link="https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/"
sk="tooltip_parent"} (free online)

Most topics are treated in that book. Links to the relevant chapters can
be found throughout the modules. However, some topics must be
complemented from other sources. This book is also complemented by some
chapters from

Ross Anderson, [Security
Engineering](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/rja14/book.html "Link"){.inline_disabled
target="_blank"}, 3rd edition (free online)

Reading instructions are also added to the modules in Canvas.

Another option is

Bruce Schneier et al., Cryptography Engineering [library
link](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.focus.lib.kth.se/doi/book/10.1002/9781118722367){.external
target="_blank"}. (Free online for KTH students)

There are some [drafted reading
instructions](https://github.com/OpenSecEd/appliedcrypto/issues/72#issue-2201919440 "Link"){.inline_disabled
target="_blank"}, written by Arber Limani for tilkry24. The lectures
have changed order a bit since then, but content-wise the same should
apply.

I am also looking into the following two books as alternatives, if you read 
either of them, please let me [dbosk] know:

  - "Real World Cryptography" by David Wong (Manning)
  - "Serious Cryptography" by Jean-Philippe Aumasson (No Starch Press)

I suggest that you [check if they are available in the KTH 
library](https://www.kth.se/biblioteket) (just search for them).

Finally, a recommended (but not mandatory) book for digging deeper into
the crypto part of applied crypto, glancing towards the follow up course
[DD2448 Foundations of
Cryptography](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2448?l=en){.inline_disabled
target="_blank"}, is

Boneh and Shoup, [Applied
Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/){.external target="_blank"}
(free online)

There will also be some research articles, linked from slides or
assignments and the Canvas modules.

Upcoming: See reading recommendations for individual lectures for more
detailed pointers to book chapters and sections or specific research
articles.
