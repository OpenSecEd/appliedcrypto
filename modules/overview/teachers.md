### Teachers

-   Daniel Bosk \[DB, dbosk@kth.se\] (course responsible, lecturer)

### Student representation (course board, kursnämnd)

At least two students will represent the course participants; they can
be contacted to give feedback to the teachers, and will participate in
discussions about the course evaluation. Please contact
[dbosk@kth.se](mailto:dbosk@kth.se){target="_blank"} with subject \"
\[tilkryYY\] student representation\" if you\'re available! This way,
there\'s more student influence and we can solicit and react to
suggestions for course improvements much faster.
