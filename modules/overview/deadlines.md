To pass the course and get credits in LADOK, you must complete the
assignments. Once you\'ve gotten a passing grade on all assignments the
results are automatically transferred to LADOK.

Some assignments are graded automatically, those can be finished at any
time. Other assignments must be presented for a TA. Those can be
presented during the lab sessions. Some assignments have dedicated lab 
sessions.

After the course you can only present such assignments during the tilkry 
sessions of [Lab Week in June](https://www.kth.se/social/group/labbvecka/ "Link"){.inline_disabled target="_blank"}.
