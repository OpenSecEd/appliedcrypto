To pass the course and get credits in LADOK, you must complete the
assignments. Once you\'ve gotten a passing grade on all assignments the
results are automatically transferred to LADOK.

Some assignments are graded automatically, those can be finished at any
time. Other assignments must be presented for a TA. Those can only be
presented during the designated presentation sessions. After the course
you can only present such assignments during the tilkry sessions of [Lab
Week in
June](https://www.kth.se/social/group/labbvecka/ "Link"){.inline_disabled
target="_blank"}.

There are two modules in LADOK: INL1 and LAB1. Which assignments belong
to which module can be found under
[Assignments](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/assignments "Assignments"){course-type="navigation"
api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/assignments"
api-returntype="[Assignment]"} (*select \"by type\" instead of the
default \"by date\" in the top right corner*). Then you can figure out
what\'s missing if you don\'t get your grades in LADOK.
