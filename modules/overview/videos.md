For now, some videos are on FeedbackFruits. Pending integration of
FeedbackFruits with Canvas at KTH, you\'ll have to sign up explicitly.

## How to sign up to FeedbackFruits

There are two options:

1.  SSO option using Microsoft Teams and KTH \-\-- don\'t use this
    option! (It breaks since it thinks that \@ug.kth.se is a working
    email domain, it isn\'t.)
2.  Sign up with email. Use your KTH (@kth.se) email address.

## E-mail option: Sign up with your e-mail

1.  Go
    to [https://eu.feedbackfruits.com](https://eu.feedbackfruits.com/){.inline_disabled
    target="_blank"}.
2.  Click on the signup button on the upper right corner.
3.  Choose Login with E-mail.
4.  Enter your kth.se address.
5.  Choose a password \-\-- don\'t use the \"send a magic link\", it
    doesn\'t work when FBF is embedded in Canvas.

## If you can sign up but don\'t get access to a video

1.  Go back and click the link to the video again.
2.  If it still doesn\'t work, try the links from another lecture to see
    whether it\'s a problem with that particular link despite reloading.
3.  If it is a problem with a particular link but not with others, let
    us know. Otherwise check your login status on FeedbackFruits.
