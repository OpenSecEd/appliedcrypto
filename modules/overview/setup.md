### Format

**Most class activities are hybrid,** most are on Zoom and in a classroom. But 
**some are only on campus**.

**There are several lecturers and lecture formats**, make sure to
check whether the lectures are live without recording, recorded
and/or flipped classroom style and prepare accordingly (including
attendance), as specified in the weekly modules.

### Final grade

**You pick your grade by choosing optional LAB assignments for
higher grades.** See also the [grading criteria](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/59543/pages/grading-criteria "Grading criteria"){.inline_disabled target="_blank" api-endpoint="https://canvas.kth.se/api/v1/courses/59543/pages/grading-criteria" api-returntype="Page"}.

More on this on the coming pages.

### How the lab sessions work

Most lab sessions are help and presentation sessions for the mandatory and 
optional assignments that you pick.

The exception to this is the ProVerif lab sessions. However, they are marked as 
such in TimeEdit. And you'll find more details in the weekly modules when that 
lab session approaches. You'll need to book which session you attend.

We will use the [stay-a-while queue for the 
course](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/DD2520) to serve 
students during the lab help and presentation sessions. If
a lab is offered on zoom, the students have to create a
temporary zoom meeting link and enter
it into the location field in the queue system when they want to
get help or present something. When it is your turn to get
served, the TA will use the provided zoom link to help you. 

Most lab sessions will be on Zoom. But some are available on campus too.
You can see which in the [TimeEdit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/kth/web/?en=t) 
schedule for the course.

### When to present your solution of an optional assignment for higher grades

In a lab session. Unless otherwise specified (the Proverif lab), all
lab sessions are help and presentation sessions (help will be prioritized), 
where you can ask questions to TAs.

If you want to present a solution of an optional assignment during such
a session, you can join the queue and state in comments \"AES pres\"
or \"Cryptopals pres\" along with your zoom link if the session is on
zoom. A TA will join you on a best-effort basis, i.e. if the queue
allows as helping students with their assignment has priority, you may
have to wait a bit.

When there are many submissions that should be presented, we will schedule 
bookable slots for presentations to prevent queueing delays. So submit as soon 
as you're done with an assignment and ready to present. (Don't worry, you can 
submit again if you find mistakes later.)

### How the seminars work

You do the preparation assignments that are listed, attend the seminars 
(mandatory) where we will do tasks and discussions.
After the seminar you do any specified follow-up assignments.
