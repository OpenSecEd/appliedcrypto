**How INL1 works:** it has 3 components:
1. a quiz on cryptography, broken up into several parts, name starting with 
   INL1Quiz;
2. a written assignment (INL1Written), and
3. an oral part (INL1Oral) where you answer questions about your written 
   assignment. 

When you have a passing grade on all three components, you pass INL1 and will 
get a grade in LADOK.

INL1Quiz is done during the course.
While INL1Written and INL1Oral are done at the end of the course.
