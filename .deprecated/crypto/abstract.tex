To fully understand how many security mechanisms can be implemented we need 
cryptography.
Cryptography has a central role for many security mechanisms.
This learning session is intended to prepare the students with high-level 
overview of cryptography.

We will treat
Chapter 5 in Anderson's \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
Chapter 14 in Gollmann's \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
To practice your understanding of these mechanisms it is recommended to do 
exercises 14.2, 14.3 and 14.7 in~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
