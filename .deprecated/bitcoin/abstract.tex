This learning session focuses on how to design systems by first analysing the 
the desired properties and then combining the proper cryptographics mechanisms 
to achieve them.
We will specifically look at the Bitcoin cryptographic 
currency~\cite{Nakamoto2008bap}.
Other sources with good overviews of Bitcoin 
are~\cite{Peck2012btc,Kaminsky2013lct}.
