In this learning session we cover the cryptographic primitive with which we can
create authentication mechanisms, namely hash functions and digital signatures.

We cover the parts of Chapter 5 in
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea} and
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
